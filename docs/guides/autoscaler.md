# Sherpa AutoScaler

The Sherpa internal autoscaler iterates through stored scaling policies and performs decisions based on the configured checks. The autoscaler will calculate a decision for every enabled checks, eventually consolidating these into a single final decision. If there are two checks for a job group which request a scale out and scale in activity, the scale out will always take priority.
